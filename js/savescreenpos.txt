1. Add a variable (to store the current position) in the page's Global Variable Declaration
var savepos;
2. Add a class to your report region (in my example, I used the word "position")
3. Create a ‘click’ dynamic action (using the jQuery selector from step 2 (class=”position”)) to execute the following .js
savepos = $(window).scrollTop();
This will update the current screen position to the global variable.
4. Create an ‘after refresh’ dynamic action for your report region to execute the following .js
$(window).scrollTop(savepos);
This will keep the user at the same screen position they were at before $hit changed!
5. Wallop!
